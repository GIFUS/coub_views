# Coub Views cheat!
This Python script was written in order to wind up views on the service coub.com

## How to use
   
- Step 1. Load proxys option. 
```txt
    [1] Load Proxys from APIs
    [2] Load Proxys from proxys.txt
```
You can choose 1 to download the proxy from the free api or choose 2 to download your proxies from proxys.txt

- Step 2. Coub link format. 
```txt
    Coub id:
```
In this field, we need to enter the coub id. You can get it at the end of the link.

Exapmle: https://coub.com/view/jb9ucpo --> **jb9ucpo** - This coub id

- Step 3. Threads. 
```txt
    Threads (Recommended: 500 | Max: 1000):
```
This is the field for specifying the threads to perform the view. The speed of cheating depends on this parameter, but keep in mind that with a weak PC, there will be lags and failures.
